# 🪝 Honest React Hook Dependencies

# 📢 Context

We're introducing a new **ESLint** rule called `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` this
week. The rule is a great guide for handling dependencies in React Hooks
and guard against lying about them.

# 🤯 Why?!

It will help us catch potential, hard to debug, bugs and to use React Hooks
in their intended way.

# 🧠 Mental Model

The dependency array is a way to **synchronize** data and should not be viewed as
a sort of **life-cycle** handler.
